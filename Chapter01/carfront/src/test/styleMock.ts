// This file is used to mock CSS imports in tests. It prevents errors related to CSS modules when running tests with Vitest.
// It exports an empty object, which is sufficient for the test environment.    
// This is a workaround for the issue with CSS imports in Vitest.
// In a real-world scenario, you might want to use a more sophisticated CSS mocking strategy, depending on your testing needs.
